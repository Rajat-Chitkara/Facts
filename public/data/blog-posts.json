Welcome to Whittier, Alaska, a town so unique that it challenges our very notion of what a community can be.</p><h2>The Building That Is a Town</h2><p>Begich Towers, a 14-story concrete monolith, houses nearly all of Whittier's 272 residents. Built in the 1950s as military housing, this brutalist structure has evolved into something unprecedented: a vertical town where neighbors aren't just next door—they're upstairs, downstairs, and down the hall.</p><h2>Life Under One Roof</h2><p>Within Begich Towers, residents have access to a post office, general store, laundromat, health clinic, and even a small hotel for visitors. The building's first floor houses the city offices and police department, while the school is connected via an underground tunnel.</p><p>This unique living arrangement creates an intimacy rarely found in modern communities. Children play in heated hallways during harsh winters, and impromptu gatherings happen in the building's common areas. Everyone knows everyone, and privacy takes on a different meaning when your mayor might live three floors up.</p><h2>The Challenges of Isolation</h2><p>Whittier's isolation is both its charm and its challenge. Accessible only by a single-lane tunnel that alternates traffic direction every 30 minutes, the town can feel cut off from the outside world. During winter storms, residents might not see sunlight for days, relying entirely on their building community for social interaction.</p><p>Yet this isolation has fostered remarkable resilience and cooperation. When someone needs help, the entire building responds. Medical emergencies, childcare, and even simple favors become community efforts.</p><h2>A Glimpse into Alternative Living</h2><p>Whittier represents more than just an oddity—it's a functioning example of high-density, community-focused living. As urban planners worldwide grapple with housing crises and social isolation, this Alaskan town offers insights into how physical proximity can foster genuine community bonds.</p><p>Whether Whittier's model could work elsewhere remains debatable, but its existence proves that unconventional approaches to community living can not only survive but thrive in the most challenging environments.</p>",
